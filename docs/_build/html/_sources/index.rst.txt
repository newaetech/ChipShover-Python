ChipSHOVER Python API Documentation
======================================

ChipSHOVER is an XY(Z) Table controller table and driver. Based on
Marlin 3D printer firmware, it accepts G-Codes for PC based control
of its position and various other functionality. It also
includes an LCD for status readout, as well as a joystick/buttons
for quick positioning and other control.

This Python API is designed as a simple way to control the 
ChipSHOVER from a programming language.
